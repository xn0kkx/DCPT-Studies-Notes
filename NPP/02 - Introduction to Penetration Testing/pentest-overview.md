# Pentesting Overview

## What Is Pentesting?
Pentesting is a security test aimed at identifying and exploiting weaknesses and security vulnerabilities in order to measure the degree of risk and impact these weaknesses may have on an organization. Essentially, a pentest simulates a real hacker attack.

By performing a pentest, a company can enhance its security posture and proactively address the discovered risks.
