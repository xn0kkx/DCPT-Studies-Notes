# Types of Security Tests & Approaches

## Pentesting Modalities
- **Black Box**: No prior information.  
- **Gray Box**: Partial information.  
- **White Box**: Full information.  

*(Information regarding the target environment is provided accordingly.)*

## Types of Pentesting
- **Web**: Testing web applications.  
- **Mobile**: Testing mobile applications.  
- **Network**: Testing network infrastructure.  
- **Wireless**: Testing wireless networks.  
- **Physical**: Physical security assessments.  
- **Social Engineering**: Phishing, pretexting, etc.  
- **Stress Testing (DDoS)**: Simulating denial-of-service attacks.  

- **External Pentest**: Conducted from the Internet.  
- **Internal Pentest**: Performed from within the clientâ€™s environment.

## Other Security Assessments

### Vulnerability Assessment
- **Description**: Automated scanning with a report.  
- **Advantages**: Fast and automated.  
- **Disadvantages**: May produce false positives; does not exploit vulnerabilities; finds only known issues.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
- **Description**: Analyzes and exploits findings from a vulnerability assessment report to produce a more comprehensive and tailored report, reducing false positives.

### Red Team
- **Description**: A broader approach with a specific objective and no strict rules. May include social engineering and physical attacks.  
- **Advantages**: Provides a realistic view of risks; tests incident response capabilities.  
- **Disadvantage**: High cost.

## Example Approaches
- **Specific System Testing** (e.g., web app, mobile app, server): Pentest or Vulnerability Assessment.  
- **Complete External Environment** (no social engineering): Full external pentest.  
- **Complete Environment with Specific Objective**: Red Team engagement.  
- **Large-Scale Quick Testing** (surface-level): Vulnerability Assessment.
