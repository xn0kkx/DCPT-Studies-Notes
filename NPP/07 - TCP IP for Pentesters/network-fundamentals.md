# Network Fundamentals

## Computer Networks
Communication between two or more computers, enabling resource sharing and distributed services.

## Hosts, Servers & Clients
- **Host**: The name assigned to a computer on the network (hostname).
- **Server**: A machine that provides one or more services to other devices on the network.
- **Client**: A machine or application that consumes services offered by a server.

## Protocols
Protocols define rules and formats so that diverse hardware and software can interoperate.
- **Example**: TCP/IP  
- Communication only works because both ends understand the same protocol.

## Physical & Logical Addresses, Ports
- **Physical Address (MAC)**  
  - 6-byte hardware identifier burned into the NIC.  
  - First 3 bytes = vendor OUI; last 3 bytes = unique device ID.  
- **Logical Address (IP)**  
  - Assigned per network (e.g., IPv4 as four decimal octets).  
- **Ports**  
  - Range 0–65535, used by TCP/UDP to identify specific services.  
  - Default assignments in `/etc/services` (Linux) or well-known ports (0–1023).  
  - Services can be configured to run on non-standard ports.  
- **Socket**  
  - Combines IP and port as `IP:PORT`, e.g. `192.168.200.10:8080`.

## Header & Payload
Most network protocols consist of:
- **Header**: Metadata with protocol-specific fields (addresses, flags, lengths).
- **Payload**: The actual data carried by the protocol.
