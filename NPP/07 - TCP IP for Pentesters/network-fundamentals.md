# Network Fundamentals

## Computer Networks  
Communication between two or more computers, enabling resource sharing and distributed services.

## Hosts, Servers & Clients  
- **Host**: Name assigned to a computer on the network (hostname).  
- **Server**: Provides one or more services to other machines.  
- **Client**: Consumes services offered by a server.

## Protocols  
Define rules and formats so that diverse hardware and software can interoperate.  
- **Example**: TCP/IP  
- Communication only works because both ends understand the same protocol.

## Physical & Logical Addresses, Ports  
- **Physical Address (MAC)**  
  - 6-byte factory-burned identifier (first 3 bytes = vendor OUI; last 3 = unique device).  
- **Logical Address (IP)**  
  - Assigned per network (e.g., IPv4 expressed in four decimal octets).  
- **Ports**  
  - Range 0â€“65535, used by TCP/UDP to identify services (see `/etc/services`).  
  - Can be remapped per service.  
- **Socket**  
  - Combination of IP and port, e.g. `192.168.200.10:8080`.

## Protocol Header & Payload  
Most protocols consist of:  
- **Header**: Metadata (addresses, flags, lengths) with protocol-specific structure.  
- **Payload**: The actual data carried by the protocol.
